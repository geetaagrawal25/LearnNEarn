LearnNearn 
Token Rewarding system

Here comes, the project “Learn&Earn” – This project is in attempt to solve the
“less-interactive-audience” problem by incentivizing the participants who respond to the
answers of other fellow participants and help them learn better & faster by
accumulating & rewarding “Karma Points". These karma points can be redeemed at
other learning events (like Talk at Linux, in-person ticket to Web3 live events etc).

We have created a Discord bot to reward the community whose activity helps others.
So it tracks the messages and initiate the transaction based on the emojis.

Ensure that you have python installed in your system.

Run the below command to install the dependencies

 `pip install requirements`
 
Create a new file and name it `config.py` & place it on the current directory.

You can enter all the credentials required in that file - sample is attached.

run - `python bot_contract_interaction.py` to start the bot, you'd the response in your server if everything's given correctly


The smart contracts – ERC-20 & ERC 721 for token accumulation. ERC-20 is the karma token the

user accumulates & after a certain threshold, gets eligible for an NFT. That time, the burning of ERC-
20 token & minting of ERC-721 unique tokens takes place. These unique tokens can be used as a

gate pass for future tech events. (This is subjected to the partnership the learning group has with
other third parties like Linux foundation, Polkadot, Cousera etc., the idea is to use this NFT token as
a pass to enter a tech event which is paid to general public).

 Clone the repo and run npm install.
